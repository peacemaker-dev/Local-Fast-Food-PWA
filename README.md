## Features & Functionality

- Responsive, mobile-first design focused on quick ordering and small-screen usability.
- WhatsApp-first ordering: one-tap ordering via WhatsApp link or pre-filled message templates for common orders.
- Manual order tracking: simple tracking instructions or a lightweight tracking UI so customers can check order status or pickup readiness.
- Clear menu & pricing structure: transparent item pricing, combos, and delivery fees to reduce support requests.
- FAQ section to cover common questions about ordering, allergens, delivery windows, and refunds.
- Lightweight HTML & CSS only — built for speed, minimal load, and compatibility with low-bandwidth connections.
- Accessibility-minded markup (semantic HTML, readable type sizes, clear call-to-action contrast).
- Local customer convenience: localized copy, contact methods, and business hours tailored to the service area.
- Progressive Web App basics: manifest and service worker for installability and basic offline caching if included.

## How to Use / Deploy

- This is primarily a static front-end built with HTML and CSS — no build tools required for core pages.
- To preview locally: open index.html in a browser or serve with a simple static server (e.g., python -m http.server).
- To enable PWA features locally: serve over HTTPS or use a local dev server that supports service workers.
- To publish: push the repo to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.
- If you add server-side APIs (order processing, menus, payments), include deployment/run instructions and environment variable details here.

## Contributing

- For updates, bug fixes, content changes, or accessibility improvements: fork the repo, make changes, and open a pull request.
- Keep changes focused, mobile-first, and performant (optimize images, avoid large libraries).
- When changing the UI, include screenshots or a short demo URL in PR descriptions.
- If adding automated builds or CI, document the required steps and configuration in this README.
